      "I am a student of multiple STEMist programs. This is the 3rd or 4th time that I have attended a STEMist program and they always create new material that fits everyone's academic level. I honestly had a fantastic time with all their programs and I enjoyed them and learned so much. From topics like earthquakes to volcanoes to counting and probability. They always have multiple TAs to help you with your questions on the material. I really have learned a lot from STEMist and am so glad I found out about this program. Thank You all the STEMist teachers I have learned a lot from you.",

    content: `I am a 2nd year returning student. This year I attended STEMist's summer program, "Intro to USABO and Machine Learning", "Intro to USA Biology Olympiad", "The Earth: Physics, Chemistry, ES, and Astronomy", and finally “AMC8 and MATHCOUNTS”, which is every class that was available to me. Teachers were outgoing and encouraging, receptive to feedback, and adapting accordingly. They were always willing to help people who were lost and stayed behind to explain details. These classes were very cool, with interactive polls, funny science memes, and Kahoots, which motivated kids just like me to take notes, participate, and kindled mutual competition. I really think these classes were worth the time and energy to come to. I am definitely going to register for future STEMist classes. Thank you STEMist volunteers for all your hard work to make these classes possible!`,

      "I would recommend STEMist because they explain everything so most people in the meet understand. If someone has any questions they will explain once they see the question (immediately). They make slides explaining everything about the subject. If the subject the instructor is going to present is a bit hard, then they will try to simplify it. If somebody says the subject is a bit too hard or they didn’t understand something the instructor will go back and try to explain it more easily and the instructor tries their best so everyone understands the subject. At the end of each lesson if there is more time they will explain a previous topic or they will explain slides that they didn’t go over or because there wasn’t enough time to explain them. They also make interesting Kahoots with questions on the topic.",

      "I took the AMC8 and MATHCOUNTS Course this summer. So the course was pretty challenging, and I learned a lot of things a didn't know before, like some divisibility rules, or the nCr formula. I would also say this course is really engaging and interesting, even if you aren't interested in math, for this course will still help teach you tricks and tips on how to solve AMC8 problems and other math questions. 5/5, definitely!",

      "I took pretty much all the classes that were offered at STEMist for the summer of 2022.  The teachers at STEMist strive to make sure students are engaged with the topic, asking if anybody as questions after segments. At the end, students will be asked if the topic was too hard, so that future lessons/topics will be adjusted accordingly. The lessons are carefully planned and students will be given chances to interact (questions or activities). I would definitely sign up for more classes!",

    content: `I was a student of STEMist’s “Introduction to Machine Learning and USA Computing Olympiad” 2022 Summer Course, and I had a great experience. The schedules and lessons are well organized, as the team sends an email covering what we learned last class and what we will learn today. My wonderful teachers, Shanker, Justin, and Snehil always provide informative while fun lessons to keep students engaged. The teachers always make sure students understand the content, remind and encourage students to ask questions if they are confused, and are passionate to help. Every lesson, there are multiple hands-on problems/activities to demonstrate our knowledge and there are sometimes Kahoots at the end to summarize what we have learned. I really enjoyed this class, and I will definitely sign up for more STEMist classes in the future. Thank you STEMist!`,
