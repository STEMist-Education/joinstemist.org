          Our goal is not only to teach kids STEM. We hope to empower students
          with foundational concepts they will use throughout their life. To
          accomplish this, we host workshops over Zoom to help students learn
          about various topics in our modern society. These workshops take place
          during school breaks such as Spring and Winter break. In the summer,
          we opt for a comprehensive curriculum that delves more in-depth into
          STEM topics.{" "}
